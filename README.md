combination of limits on EFT dim-8 operators

## channels to combine:  
CMS ssWW  
CMS ZZ  
ATLAS ssWW  
ATLAS WZ  
CMS WZ  
CMS WV semileptonic ?  
more?

Delphes for detector effects?  

## Outline:  
For each analysis:  
* sample generation (MG+Pythia)  
* rwgt to discrete parameter values  
* validation of reweighting procedure  
* quadratic fit for interpolation  
* statistical analysis with available information -> 1D limits (2D later)  
* compare with official results  

Combination:  
* available info on uncertainties  
* correlations?  
* run combination -> how do limits change?
