For each analysis:  
* sample generation (MG+Pythia)  
* rwgt to discrete parameter values  
* validation of reweighting procedure  
* quadratic fit for interpolation  
* statistical analysis with available information -> 1D limits (2D later)  
* compare with official results  

Combination:  
* available info on uncertainties  
* correlations?  
* run combination -> how do limits change?
